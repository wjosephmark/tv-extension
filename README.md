Welcome Trader! Let's get you on the road to riches!

If you are here, you are probably a sweaty day trader, like myself (at times). 
I quickly found that the slight delay between TradingView (my charting tool) and InteractiveBrokers (my broker) was too long for me.

To get started, pull the repo

`git pull`

Next, open chrome, navigate to the extensions, enable developer mode, load unpacked, and point to the public folder in this project. 

Your extension is now running!
