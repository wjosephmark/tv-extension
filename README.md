# Welcome, Trader! ðŸš€

Glad to have you here, ready to start your journey to riches!

If you're reading this, chances are you're a **dedicated day trader** (or aspiring one) like meâ€”fighting the clock and trying to stay ahead of the market. I quickly realized that the slight delay between **TradingView** (my charting tool) and **Interactive Brokers** (my broker) was just too much to handle during those high-stakes moments. So, I built this extension to solve that issue and speed up the process.

### Getting Started:

1. **Clone the Repo**:
    If you haven't already cloned the repository to your local machine, run the following command in your terminal to clone it:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```

    Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git` with the actual URL of your repo.

    After cloning, navigate into the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

    If you already have the repo and just need to update it, you can pull the latest changes:

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

    (Note: Replace `main` with the default branch name if it's different, like `master`.)


2. **Set up the Extension**:

    To install and run the extension in Chrome, follow these steps:

    1. **Open Chrome** and navigate to the **Extensions page** by typing `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.
    
    2. **Enable Developer Mode**:
        - In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, toggle the **Developer Mode** switch to "On."
    
    3. **Load the Extension**:
        - Click the **Load Unpacked** button.
        - In the file dialog that opens, **select the `public/` folder** inside the project directory.
    
    > Once the folder is selected, the extension will be loaded and activated immediately. You should see it listed in your Chrome extensions with an icon in the toolbar.

    4. **Verify the Extension**:
        - To make sure the extension is working, look for the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar. You can also check the Extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`) to see if it's enabled.
    
    5. **Test the Extension**:
        - Open a new tab and check if the extension is functioning as expected. Follow any specific instructions in the extension to test its features.

    Your extension is now live and running! ðŸŽ‰

    > **Note:** If you make any changes to the extension files, you may need to **reload** it by going back to `chrome://extensions/` and clicking the **Reload** button next to the extension.

Your extension is now live and running! ðŸŽ‰
